# OpenIG - MiAMI

## Build The Source Code

In order to build the project from the command line follow these steps:

### Prepare your Environment

You will need the following software to build the code.

```
Software               | Required Version
---------------------- | ----------------
Java Development Kit   | 1.8 and above
Maven                  | 3.1.0 and above
Git                    | 1.7.6 and above
```
The following environment variables should be set:

- `JAVA_HOME` - points to the location of the version of Java that Maven will use.
- `MAVEN_OPTS` - sets some options for the jvm when running Maven.

For example your environment variables might look something like this:

```
JAVA_HOME=/usr/jdk/jdk1.8.0_201
MAVEN_HOME=C:\Program Files\Apache_Maven_3.6.0
MAVEN_OPTS='-Xmx2g -Xms2g -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:MaxPermSize=512m'
```

### Getting the Code

If you want to run the code unmodified you can simply clone the ForgeRock PSD2-Accelerators repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/ForgeRock/miami-accelerators.git
git checkout miami-prod
```


### Building the Code

The build process and dependencies are managed by Maven. The first time you build the project, Maven will pull 
down all the dependencies and Maven plugins required by the build, which can take a longer time. 
Subsequent builds will be much faster!

```
cd /OpenIG/openig-miami-filters
mvn package
```

Maven builds the binary in `openig-miami-filters/target/`. The file name format is `openig-miami-filters-<nextversion>-SNAPSHOT.jar` , 
for example "openig-miami-filters-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar".


### Adding the library to OpenIG war

+ Download and unzip the OpenIG.war from ForgeRock backstage:

```
https://backstage.forgerock.com/downloads/browse/ig/latest
$ mkdir ROOT && CD ROOT
$ jar -xf ~/Downloads/IG-6.5.1.war
```

+ Copy the newly generated jar file to /ROOT/WEB-INF/lib folder

```
$ cp ~/openig-miami-filters-<nextversion>-SNAPSHOT.jar WEB-INF/lib
```

+ Rebuild the war file: 

```
$ jar -cf ../ROOT.war *
```

### Important Notes
+ Using spring 5.2.1.RELEASE. The following jars must be added to WEB-INF/lib

```
spring-beans-5.2.1.RELEASE
spring-core-5.2.1.RELEASE
spring-jcl-5.2.1.RELEASE-sources
spring-web-5.2.1.RELEASE
```

+ Make sure the cookie generated for new AM instance has correct domain to be visible in the protected APP and in AM.
